# Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Kali Linux (UFW)

## Objective:
Configure and test basic firewall rules using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Kali Linux.

## Steps Performed:
- Installed and enabled UFW
- Listed existing firewall rules
- Blocked Telnet port (23)
- Tested the rule using telnet
- Allowed SSH port (22)
- Removed test block rule
- Saved all commands in a text file

## Files Included:
- `firewall_steps.txt`: All firewall commands used
- `screenshot1.png`: UFW enabled
- `screenshot2.png`: Port 23 blocked
- `screenshot3.png`: Telnet test failed (as expected)
- `screenshot4.png`: Final firewall status

## Summary:
UFW is a simple and effective tool to manage firewall rules in Linux. It helps secure the system by allowing or denying traffic through specific ports. In this task, we blocked Telnet (port 23) and allowed SSH (port 22), tested the configuration, and saved the results.
